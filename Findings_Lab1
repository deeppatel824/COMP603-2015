1. Chosen Compiler: Tiny C Compiler

Scan/Lexical/Tokenize: win32/include/winapi/wincon.h has the scan funstion. TCC.h has the fucktion for token. 

Parse: tccpp.c and tccasm.c has the function for parse.

AST (Abstract Syntax Tree): configure file has the function of building tree. I also found stack pointer on examples/ex2.c which is similar to tree.

Optimization: It is contained in x86_64-gen.c 
Code generation:

something interesting: TCC is designed to work for slow computers with little 
disk space.
